# Project Task List

These are not in order. And probably don't make much sense.

- [x] Set up repo
- [x] Add responsive voice to page
- [x] Set up Tasker profile to open web page
- [ ] BUG: When Tasker opens the web page, sound doesn't autoplay. Play button works fine.
- [ ] Add text module
- [ ] Add datetime module (moment?)
- [ ] Add customisable module system
- [ ] Modules: move module into div, ensure correct text is being extracted
- [x] Add text generation button
- [ ] Add text pause button
- [ ] Add text rewind button(?)
- [ ] Add module class to store info about script modules
- [ ] Get save/load with localStorage working
- [ ] Transpile ES6 so it can require and arrow function and class and all that
- [ ] Migrate original code to classes/modules
- [ ] App should pause until ResponsiveVoice has been loaded
